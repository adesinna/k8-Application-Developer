This is a pod to node relationship, the ones it should accept or the one it should reject.

Taints are set on nodes while toleration are set on pods, if a taint  is tolerant of pod, it allows it to be created there.


Imagine you have a big playground (your Kubernetes cluster) with several play areas (nodes) for different
activities (running containers). Now, let's talk about "taints" and how they work:

Taints are like special signs that you put on a specific play area (node) to say, "Hey, only certain kids (pods)
are allowed to play here!" These signs have two parts: a "key" and a "value." For example, you could have a sign that says "Color=Red."

Next, we have "taint effects," which describe how the sign affects the playground. There are three types:

1. "NoSchedule" sign means that only kids with a matching sign in their hand (tolerations) are allowed to play
on that specific area (node). Other kids without the right sign can't join the fun there.

2. "PreferNoSchedule" sign is a bit more relaxed. It suggests that kids without the matching sign should try
to play somewhere else, but if they really need to play there, they can.

3. "NoExecute" sign is strict. It not only stops new kids without the right sign from playing but even kicks
out any kids already playing there without the right sign!

So, when you "apply a taint" to a node, it's like putting one of these special signs on that play area.
You specify the "key" and "value" of the sign, and you pick one of the "taint effects" to say how strict you want it to be.


To be a taint on a node

kubectl taint nodes node_name key=value:taint-effect

kubectl describe node node01 | grep -i Taint # to see the taint on a node

kubectl taint nodes node_name key=value:taint-effect- # notice the -, it is to remove the taint

Taints on nodes does not guarantee that the pod with its toleration will be placed on it, because it can try
another nodes before trying it.
