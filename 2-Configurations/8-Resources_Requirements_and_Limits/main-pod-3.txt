Sure, I can help you create a Kubernetes (K8s) object for a LimitRange. A LimitRange is a resource policy in Kubernetes that specifies constraints on resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) for pods in a namespace. Here's an example of how you might define a LimitRange object in YAML format:



Replace your-namespace with the actual namespace where you want to apply this LimitRange.

In this example, we've defined a LimitRange named my-limit-range with various resource constraints for containers in the namespace. Here's a breakdown of what each field means:

- max: Maximum resource limits that a container can request.
- min: Minimum resource limits that a container can request.
- default: Default resource limits for a container if not specified.
- defaultRequest: Default resource requests for a container if not specified.
- maxLimitRequestRatio: The ratio between the resource limit and request. This is used to validate that the resource request is not too much greater than the resource limit.

Once you've created this YAML definition, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command:

kubectl apply -f your-limit-range.yaml


Replace your-limit-range.yaml with the actual filename of the YAML file you've created.
