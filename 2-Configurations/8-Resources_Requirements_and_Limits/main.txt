Every pod needs an amount of resources for it to run on the node.

Resources are the needed memory and cpus the pod needs, the limit is the maximum resources it can use on a node.

see pod-1.yaml

The scheduler looks for a node that have this resource available, the limit is the max it can consume.

see pod-2.yaml

However, a pod cannot consume more than its cpu limit but can exceed the limit of the memory, and the pod will be terminated.

The best is to just set request without using limits.
