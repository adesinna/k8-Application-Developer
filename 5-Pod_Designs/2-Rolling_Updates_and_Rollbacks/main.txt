Rollout and Version:
    When you create a deployment with a container version say v1, a rollout is triggered and a new deployment revision is
    created, if the tag changes on the container, it triggers another one.


To see the status of rollout:

kubectl rollout status deployment/deployment_name

To see history

kubectl rollout history deployment/deployment_name


Deployment Strategy:
    Recreate:
        This deletes all the pods at once, and create new ones to replace them

    Rolling Update:
        This deletes it one by one, and replace one by one.



Edit your deployment
kubectl edit deployment frontend # if you cant find the deployment

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml # add the specific image you want

kubectl rollout undo deployment/deployment_name # this will revert to the specific deployment
