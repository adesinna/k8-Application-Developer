Labels and Selectors are used to map pods to nodes, like filtering

Labels are properties of k8s objects, selectors use labels for filtering.

kubectl get pods --selector key1=val1 # this will get pods that have only that label

annotations:
 this is used for information for integration with some external tools


kubectl get pods --selector bu=finance --no-headers | wc -l # no headers is needed to use the wc -l to count correctly

kubectl get all --selector env=prod,bu=finance,tier=frontend # the object that has the combination of these stuffs
