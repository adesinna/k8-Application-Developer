    apt install nfs-kernel-server


2. Create directory to expose to clients

    sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server


6. On each node

    sudo apt update  # or use your distribution's package manager
    sudo apt install nfs-common


7. Create the deployment

8. It deletes all data inside the container at first, so you c
