The concept of volume is storing data of the container that is running, if the container is restarted or delete storage
can wipe out.  It is always better to have a volume attached to the container.

Volumes are permanent storage for your containers, so if container is restarted nothing will happen to the container storage.

If you delete your pod, and use the volume of empty dir volume, the volume in k8 will also be delete.
So in the pod perspective the storage becomes ephemeral again.

This is why we have pv and pvc.

Persistent Volume:
    This will have to be provisioned by an administrator, pv will be created in the cluster, it will be store data permanently.
    It can be created through static or dynamic way.

    Static:
        These are PV that are provisioned by cluster administrator, which can be managed by k8 api-server


    Dynamic:
        These are PV that are created automatically based on the request.
        It uses a storage class to identify the storage that is needed to be created.


Persistent Volume Claim:
    This is a request of storage from the PV, the PVC consume the PV resources, the way a pod consume the needed
    resource for it to run. They request for specific size and access mode.

    PV and PVC should always be one to one mapping.
