The concept of volume is storing data of the container that is running, if the container is restarted or delete storage
can wipe out.  It is always better to have a volume attached to the container.

Volumes are permanent storage for your containers, so if container is restarted nothing will happen to the container storage.

If you delete your pod, and use the volume of empty dir volume, the volume in k8 will also be delete.
So in the pod perspective the storage becomes ephemeral again.

This is why we have pv and pvc.

Persistent Volume:
    This will have to be provisioned by an administrator, pv will be created in the cluster, it will be store data permanently.
    It can be created through static or dynamic way.

    Static:
        These are PV that are provisioned by cluster administrator, which can be managed by k8 api-server


    Dynamic:
        These are PV that are created automatically based on the request.
        It uses a storage class to identify the storage that is needed to be created.


Persistent Volume Claim:
    This is a request of storage from the PV, the PVC consume the PV resources, the way a pod consume the needed
    resource for it to run. They request for specific size and access mode.

    PV and PVC should always be one to one mapping.

ReadWriteOnce (RWO):

    This mode allows the volume to be mounted as read-write by a single node (Pod) at a time.
    It's suitable for scenarios where a volume should be mounted as read-write by only one Pod, providing exclusive access to that Pod.
    Common use cases include running a single-instance database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

ReadOnlyMany (ROX):

    This mode allows the volume to be mounted as read-only by multiple nodes (Pods) simultaneously.
    It's suitable for scenarios where multiple Pods need to read from the same data source, but no Pod is expected to modify the data.
    Common use cases include sharing configuration files or static assets among multiple Pods.

ReadWriteMany (RWX):

    This mode allows the volume to be mounted as read-write by multiple nodes (Pods) simultaneously.
    It's suitable for scenarios where multiple Pods need both read and write access to the same data source simultaneously.
    Common use cases include shared storage solutions like NFS, where multiple Pods need to read and write to a common file system.
