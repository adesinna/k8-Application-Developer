Volume is a way to store the data of the pod, one way to do this is to store it on the host.

It is not a good idea, since if anything happens to the node, then the volume is gone, also the external volume path
would not be persisted on every node, incase the pod was recreated in another node.

Storage solution is available for this problem, like NFS or other external storage like EBS that is independent of the
cluster.
