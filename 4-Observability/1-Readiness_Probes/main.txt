Readiness Probes:

Pod Status

- Pending:
    This is when the scheduler is trying to allocate a node to the pod


- ContainerCreating:
    This is when is it getting the image for it to start

- Running:
    This is when it is working as it should

Readiness is that the application is ready to be used, sometimes the pod might be ready but the
application isnt. Thats why we use readiness probe. This is just like a test to show that the container is truly ready for incoming network

Now we have to tie the readiness of the pod to the application readiness.

Ways to do this:
    - You can run an http probe to see if the application is ready # the developer would supply this

    - Tcp socket test

    - Execute a command that will run if the application is
